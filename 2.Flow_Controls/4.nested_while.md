# Nested while Loops in C

This document provides a comprehensive overview of nested while loops in C, covering their purpose, syntax, control flow, and practical pattern generation.

## 1. Introduction to Nested Loops

A **nested loop** is defined as one loop present inside another loop.

### Why use Nested Loops?

- **Code Repetition**: Whenever you notice a piece of code is repeated, you use a loop.
- **Loop Repetition**: Whenever you notice a loop itself is repeated multiple times, you use a nested loop.
- **Example Scenario**: To print the sequence `1 2 3 4 5`, you need one loop. To print that sequence five times (creating a grid), you need to put that loop inside another loop.

## 2. Syntax and Terminology

The structure of a nested loop involves specific terminology to understand the flow of control:

- **Outer Loop**: The "parent" loop that contains the other loop.
- **Inner Loop**: The loop residing inside the outer loop.
- **Outer/Inner Loop Condition**: The boolean expressions that determine if the respective loops continue.
- **End/Out of Loop**: The point where the loop body finishes or where control moves after a condition becomes false.

### Basic Syntax

```c
while (outer_condition) {              // Start of Outer Loop
    // Initialization for Inner Loop
    while (inner_condition) {          // Start of Inner Loop
        // Statement(s)
        // Inner Loop Update
    }                                  // End of Inner Loop
    // Outer Loop Update
}                                      // End of Outer Loop
```

## 3. Flow of Execution

The program flow always starts from the top and follows these rules:

1. **Enter Outer Loop**: If the outer condition is true, control enters the outer loop.
2. **Enter Inner Loop**: Control hits the inner loop and stays there until the inner loop condition becomes false.
3. **Repeat Inner Loop**: Every time the inner loop reaches its end, it jumps back to the inner loop condition.
4. **Exit Inner Loop**: Once the inner condition is false, control moves out of the inner loop and continues with the remaining statements in the outer loop.
5. **Repeat Outer Loop**: When the end of the outer loop is reached, control jumps back to the outer loop condition.

### Critical Point

Within the inner loop, the outer loop variable typically remains **constant** until the inner loop finishes all its iterations.

### Execution Flow Diagram

```
Start
  ↓
Outer Condition? → False → End
  ↓ True
Inner Loop Initialization
  ↓
Inner Condition? → False → Outer Loop Update → (back to Outer Condition)
  ↓ True
Inner Loop Body
  ↓
Inner Loop Update → (back to Inner Condition)
```

## 4. Understanding the X and Y Axes

A helpful shortcut for visualizing nested loops is thinking in terms of coordinates:

- **Inner Loop**: Handles the **x-axis** (horizontal printing).
- **Outer Loop**: Handles the **y-axis** (vertical movement/new lines).

### Rule of Thumb

- If your output is only on the **x-axis** or only on the **y-axis**, a single loop is sufficient.
- If the output requires **both x and y coordinates** (like a table or pattern), use a nested loop.

## 5. Practical Logic & Patterns

By making small changes to the initialization, conditions, or updates, you can create various output shapes.

### A. Fixed Grid (Square Pattern)

To print a 5x5 block where every row is `1 2 3 4 5`:

- **Outer Loop**: Runs 5 times.
- **Inner Loop**: Re-initializes `a = 1` every time and runs until `a <= 5`.

```c
int k = 1;
while (k <= 5) {
    int a = 1;
    while (a <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", a);
        a++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    k++;
}
```

**Result:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

### B. Dynamic End Condition (Triangle Pattern)

If you change the inner loop condition to `a <= k` (where `k` is the outer loop variable), the inner loop repeats an "uneven" number of times—specifically, `k` times.

```c
int k = 1;
while (k <= 5) {
    int a = 1;
    while (a <= k) {
        printf("%d ", a);
        a++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    k++;
}
```

**Result:**
```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

### C. Dynamic Start Condition

If you initialize the inner loop variable to the outer loop variable (`a = k`) and set a fixed end point, the starting value changes each row.

```c
int k = 1;
while (k <= 5) {
    int a = k;
    while (a <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", a);
        a++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    k++;
}
```

**Result:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5
3 4 5
4 5
5
```

### D. Decrementing Patterns

By using `a--` and changing conditions to `a >= k` or `a >= 1`, you can print sequences in reverse.

```c
int k = 5;
while (k >= 1) {
    int a = 5;
    while (a >= k) {
        printf("%d ", a);
        a--;
    }
    printf("\n");
    k--;
}
```

**Result:**
```
5
5 4
5 4 3
5 4 3 2
5 4 3 2 1
```

## 6. Key Takeaways for Debugging

### Re-initialization

Remember to **re-initialize** your inner loop variable (e.g., `a = 1`) inside the outer loop. If you don't, the inner loop may not execute during the second iteration of the outer loop because the variable still holds its last "false" value.

```c
// ❌ Wrong - Missing re-initialization
int k = 1, a = 1;
while (k <= 5) {
    while (a <= 5) {  // a is already > 5 after first outer iteration
        printf("%d ", a);
        a++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    k++;
}

// ✅ Correct - Proper re-initialization
int k = 1;
while (k <= 5) {
    int a = 1;  // Re-initialized each time
    while (a <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", a);
        a++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    k++;
}
```

### Infinite Loops

Always ensure **both** the inner and outer loops have update statements (like `a = a + 1` and `k = k + 1`) to avoid infinite loops.

```c
// ❌ Wrong - Missing outer loop update
int k = 1;
while (k <= 5) {
    int a = 1;
    while (a <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", a);
        a++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    // Missing: k++;  → This creates an infinite loop!
}
```

## Summary

Nested while loops are powerful tools for creating two-dimensional patterns and tables. Understanding the relationship between outer and inner loops, proper variable initialization, and the x-y axis concept will help you design and debug complex patterns effectively.

**Key Points:**
- Inner loop handles horizontal (x-axis) output
- Outer loop handles vertical (y-axis) movement
- Always re-initialize inner loop variables
- Ensure both loops have proper update statements
