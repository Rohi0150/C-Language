# Do-While Loop in C

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the do-while loop in C, covering its core concept, syntax, execution flow, and important rules.

---

## 1. Core Concept: The "At Least Once" Rule

The **do-while loop** is used when you want to execute a block of code **at least once**, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of an **ATM machine**. When you insert your card and enter your PIN, you perform at least one transaction first. Only after the transaction is complete does the machine ask, *"Do you want to continue?"*

Similarly, in programming, when you need to repeat a loop **at least once irrespective of the condition**, you use a do-while loop.

## 2. Syntax and Keywords

- **Keywords**: `do` and `while` are **separate keywords**; `dowhile` is not a single keyword.
- **Structure**: The loop starts with the `do` keyword, followed by the body of the loop, and ends with the `while` condition.
- **The Semicolon**: Unlike the standard `while` loop, a do-while loop **must end with a semicolon** (`;`) after the while condition.

### Basic Syntax

```c
do {
    // Body of the loop
} while (condition);  // Semicolon is mandatory here
```

---

## 3. Execution Flow

The flow of the program always starts from the top.

1. **Enter Loop**: The program encounters the `do` keyword and **immediately enters the body**.
2. **Execute Body**: It executes the statements inside the `do` block first.
3. **Check Condition**: Only **after** the body is completed does the program reach the `while` condition.
4. **Repeat or Exit**:
   - If the condition is **true**, the flow jumps back to the `do` keyword to execute the body again.
   - If the condition is **false**, the program exits the loop.

### Flow Diagram

```
Start
  ↓
Enter do block (no condition check)
  ↓
Execute Body
  ↓
Condition? → False → End
  ↓ True
(back to Execute Body)
```

## 4. Key Difference: `while` vs. `do-while`

The primary difference lies in the **minimum number of executions**.

| Feature           | `while` Loop                                      | `do-while` Loop                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Condition Check   | Checked **before** the body executes              | Checked **after** the body executes              |
| Min. Executions   | **Zero times** (if the condition is initially false) | **At least once** (even if the condition is false) |

### Comparison Example

If `a = 1` and the condition is `a > 1`:

- **While loop**: Checks `1 > 1` (False) → No output.
- **Do-while loop**: Prints `a` (1) first, then checks `1 > 1` (False) → Output: `1`.

```c
// while loop
int a = 1;
while (a > 1) {
    printf("%d", a);  // Never executes — condition is false from the start
}
// Output: (nothing)

// do-while loop
int a = 1;
do {
    printf("%d", a);  // Executes once before the condition is checked
} while (a > 1);
// Output: 1
```

## 5. Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic Iteration

```c
int a = 1;
do {
    printf("%d ", a);
    a = a + 1;
} while (a <= 3);
```

### Step-by-Step Trace

| Step | Action                          | Value of `a` | Condition `a <= 3` | Result        |
|------|---------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1    | Enters `do`. Prints `1`. `a` becomes `2`. | 2    | `2 <= 3` → True    | Jump to `do`  |
| 2    | Prints `2`. `a` becomes `3`.   | 3            | `3 <= 3` → True    | Jump to `do`  |
| 3    | Prints `3`. `a` becomes `4`.   | 4            | `4 <= 3` → False   | Exit Loop     |

**Output**: `1 2 3`

## 6. Important Syntax Rules & Errors

### Rule: Mandatory `while` Position

Whenever you use `do`, there must be a `while` statement with a semicolon **immediately after** the do-body.

### ❌ Compilation Error Example

If you place a statement between the `do` body and the `while` condition, the code will **fail to compile**.

```c
int a = 1;
do
    // Body starts
    a = a + 1;
    // Body ends at the first semicolon

printf("Hello"); // ❌ This statement breaks the connection!

while (a <= 5);  // ERROR: Do body does not have a 'while' immediately after
```

> **Error Message**: `"Do body not have a while"` — The compiler expects the `while` immediately after the first semicolon that terminates the `do` body if no curly braces are used.

### ✅ Correct Version

```c
int a = 1;
do {
    a = a + 1;
    printf("Hello");
} while (a <= 5);  // ✅ while immediately follows the closing brace
```

### ⚠️ No-Body (Infinite) Loop Example

If you don't provide a block (curly braces), the body is considered to be **up to the first semicolon**.

```c
int a = 1;
do
    printf("%d", a); // This is the entire body
while (a <= 5);      // Condition check — a is never incremented!
```

> In this case, since `a` is never incremented inside that single-line body, it results in an **infinite loop** because `a` remains `1`, and `1 <= 5` is always true.

---

## Summary

The `do-while` loop guarantees that the loop body executes **at least once** before the condition is evaluated. This makes it ideal for menu-driven programs, input validation, and any scenario where an action must occur before a decision is made.

**Key Points:**
- Body executes **before** the condition is checked
- Semicolon after `while (condition);` is **mandatory**
- `do` and `while` are **separate keywords** — `dowhile` is not valid
- Always use curly braces `{}` to avoid syntax errors and unintended infinite loops
- Minimum **one execution** guaranteed, unlike the `while` loop
